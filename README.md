"Now slip me snug around your ears,
I've never yet been wrong,
I'll have alook inside your mind 
And tell where you belong!"

Welcome to Hogwarts! Which Hogwarts House do you belong to? This interactive survey built using Node and Express servers asks users a series of questions in which they will select how strongly they agree or disagree with said question. Their answers will then be taken and compared to a database which then sorts them into the proper house.
